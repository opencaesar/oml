Abstract: This document describes the Ontological Modeling Language (OML). This language enables defining systems engineering vocabularies and using them to describe systems. OML is inspired by the [Web Ontology Language 2 (OWL2)](https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-syntax/) and the [Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL)](https://www.w3.org/Submission/SWRL/) and can be considered a gentler and more disciplined way of using these standards in the context of Systems Engineering. By mapping the OML constructs to a number of patterns expressed in subsets of OWL2 and SWRL, OML inherits its expressivity, modularity, extensibility, and description logic (DL) semantics, but also provides a concise and user-friendly syntax. Moreover, OML is implementd using the [Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF)](https://www.eclipse.org/modeling/emf/), which gives it a Java API and integration with a large ecosystem of modeling frameworks that has been used to develop useful tools, many of which are provided by the [openCAESAR](http://www.opencaesar.io/) project.
